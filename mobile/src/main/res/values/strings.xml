	<string name="about_text">Say goodbye to the good old plain Pac Man game on the screen! It's time to spice things up and
		get some real life action going! What better ways to go on a litter adventure around your neightboardhood
		and excercise at the same time? Brought to you by our team Pac Man Run, the new innovative way of life and entertainment!</string>
	<string name="how_to_play_text">Congratulations, you're now Pac Man, so get up and start moving! Your goal, not surprisingly, is to
	eat the marked food pellets on the map by physically travelling to the location
		without being caught by the moving ghosts. Meaning the higher your score,
		the more Pac Man Run approved you are. For each pellet that you attain, your score increases. If you are caught by a ghost,
		you have full lives to start the game again without forgoing your current score. When the game is over, your total distance
	travelled will be displayed along with your score, and the game shall start with a score of zero should you choose to continue
	playing. Happy Pac Man Running!</string>
